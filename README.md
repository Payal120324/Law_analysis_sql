# 🏛️ Law Management System - DBMS Project

## 📌 Overview

The **Law Management System** is a database management project designed to streamline and digitize the core operations of law firms, 
legal departments, or individual attorneys. It helps manage essential entities like lawyers, clients, courts, cases, and legal documents 
through a structured relational database model.

This system simplifies complex legal workflows by enabling:
- Efficient storage and retrieval of case and client data.
- Tracking of case progress, document handling, and lawyer assignments.
- Seamless integration of legal processes like hearings, documentation, and client communication.

With strong ER modeling and SQL-based interactions, this project demonstrates real-world DBMS concepts such as joins, constraints,
procedures, and triggers—all aligned with legal system workflows.
